***BACKGROUND*** 
_Short answers (a few sentences each) to general questions about reproducibility and scientific research_

Please answer the following short questions. The suggested length for each reply is 2-5 sentences, but please feel free to write more or less if applicable to your case. These do not need to be as polished as the subsequent sections, and feel free to simply answer these quickly off the top of your head.

1. Who are you and what is your research field? Include your name, affiliation, discipline, and the context of your research program necessary to frame your case study.

2. Define what the term "reproducibility" means to you generally and/or in the particular context of your case study.

3. Why do you think that reproducibility in your domain is important?

4. How or where did you learn the reproducible practices described in your case study? Mentors, classes, workshops, etc.

5. What do you see as the major pitfalls to doing reproducible research in your domain, and do you have any suggestions for working around these? Examples could include legal, logistical, human, or technical challenges.

6. What do you view as the major incentives for doing reproducible research?

The following two questions are optional.

* Are there any broad reproducibility best practices that you'd recommend for researchers in your field?

* Would you recommend any specific websites, training courses, or books for learning more about reproducibility?

WORKFLOW NARRATIVE
Section 2 represents the main workflow narrative and should be approximately 500-800 words.
2. Workflow narrative and diagram - a textual narrative describing your workflow with an accompanying diagram showing your workflow visually

The core of your case study is a textual narrative, and associated visual diagram, describing the workflow for your case study.

Please describe your workflow for this specific project, **from soup to nuts**. Imagine walking a friend or a colleague through the basic steps, paying particular attention to links between steps. Don't forget to include "messy parts", loops, aborted efforts, and failures.

To begin constructing your narrative, please start by creating a diagrammatic sketch, which you are welcome to do by hand, that shows your workflow pipeline visually. Think of this like a circuit diagram for your workflow. Boxes should represent individual steps in the process, with arrows showing how the inputs and outputs of each step relate to each other. Be sure to consider

* specialized tools and where they enter your workflow

* the "state" of the data at each stage

* collaborators

* version control repos

* products produced at various stages (graphics, summaries, etc)

* databases

* whitepapers

* customers (if any)

In concert with developing this diagram, consider how you would describe this picture to a friend or colleague. Write this description in text. While doing so, be sure that you address the following questions, where interesting, applicable, and non-obvious from context.

* For each part of that workflow:

    * How often does this step in the workflow happen?

    * How long does it take?

    * Which members of your team participate (or not)?

    * How much human intervention is involved?

        * Is that human intervention recorded in some way?

    * How much is scripted or otherwise automated?

        * What records are kept about this automation process?

    * Which software or online tools do you rely on?

        * What are its key important uses and limitations?

        * Does it make you more efficient or slow you down?

        * Does this tool affect your ability to reproduce your results?

        * Have you previously tried any other tools for this task?

        * Are you aware of tools that might make this step more efficient? If so, why have those tools not made it into your workflow?

    * How opaque is this step to a researcher external to your research group?

        * Is the necessary code online?

            * How is the documentation?

            * Are there tests?

            * Do you keep example input files alongside your code?

        * Is your raw data online?

            * Is it citeable?

            * Does the license allow external researchers to publish a replication/confirmation of your published work?

        * Is your data processing workflow online?

            * Are the scripts documented?

            * Would an external researcher know what order to run them in?

            * Would they know what parameters to use?

PAIN POINT(S)
3. Pain point(s) - an in depth discussion of ideally one, or possibly a few, sections of your workflow that you would describe as failed, incomplete, or particularly challenging in the context of reproducibility
Sections 3-5 are more detailed reflections on portions of your workflow and should each be approximately 200-400 words.

Describe in detail the steps of a reproducible workflow which you consider to be particularly painful. How do you handle these? How do you avoid them?

KEY BENEFIT(S)
4. Key achievement(s) - an in depth discussion of ideally one, or possibly a few, sections of your workflow that you are particularly proud of and feel are particularly important or useful to others

Flesh out a key step that others could benefit from.

TOOLBOX [OPTIONAL]
5. Toolbox [Optional] - if applicable, a detailed description of a particular specialized tool that plays a key role in making your workflow reproducible, if you think that the tool might be of broader interest or relevance to a general

If there is a specific tool that is critical to the achievement of reproducibility in your case study and that you feel may be underappreciated or underused, flesh it out here for benefit of others. Common tools like git or LaTeX should not be described here unless you have used them in an unconventional or particularly effective way that you feel other scientists would not know about.
